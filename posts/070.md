# üî• (#70) Configuration driven templates

July 2022

Heyo!

We're in the depths of summer now.

For me, that means working from our deck until my 2015 MBP starts burning my legs.

(But the sunshine and fresh air is worth it)

And cranking the AC so I can actually sleep at night despite the heat and humidity.

Which I am _so_ thankful for.

Our AC unit is over 30 years old, but it was supposed to last only 25 years.

It sounds _terrible_. As though it's going to implode any moment. But year after year it keeps on going...

...but I know you don't actually care about my air conditioner.

Here are some tips for you instead.

## üî• Ref vs. Reactive

Is it better to use `ref` or `reactive` when using the composition API?

Here are a few situations where `ref` is better than `reactive`.

Using `ref` on objects makes it clear where an object is reactive and where it's just a plain object:

```javascript
// I can expect this ref to update reactively
if (burger.value.lettuce) {
  // ...
}

// I have no clue if this value is reactive
if (burger.lettuce) {
  // ...
}
```

When using one of the `watch` methods, `refs` are automatically unwrapped, so they're nicer to use:

```javascript
// Ref
const refBurger = ref({ lettuce: true });
watch(
  // Not much, but it's a bit simpler to work with
  refBurger,
  () => console.log("The burger has changed"),
  { deep: true }
);

// Reactive
const reactiveBurger = reactive({ lettuce: true });
watch(
  () => burger,
  () => console.log("The burger has changed"),
  { deep: true }
);
```

One last reason why `refs` make more sense to me ‚Äî you can put `refs` into a `reactive` object. This lets you compose `reactive` objects out of `refs` and still use the underlying `refs` directly:

```javascript
const lettuce = ref(true);
const burger = reactive({
  // The ref becomes a property of the reactive object
  lettuce,
});

// We can watch the reactive object
watchEffect(() => console.log(burger.lettuce));

// We can also watch the ref directly
watch(lettuce, () => console.log("lettuce has changed"));

setTimeout(() => {
  // Updating the ref directly will trigger both watchers
  // This will log: `false`, 'lettuce has changed'
  lettuce.value = false;
}, 500);
```

## üî• Configuration driven templates

One trick I like to simplify my templates is making them _configuration-driven_.

Instead of writing a template that repeats itself like this:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <menuitem @click="openContact"> Open Contact </menuitem>
    <menuitem @click="createContact"> Create Contact </menuitem>
    <menuitem @click="sendEmail"> Send Email </menuitem>
    <menuitem @click="resetSystem" danger> Reset </menuitem>
  </div>
</template>
```

You can refactor the template to this to use configuration to drive it:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <menuitem
      v-for="item in menuItems"
      :key="item.text"
      :danger="item.danger"
      @click="item.action"
    >
      {{ item.text }}
    </menuitem>
  </div>
</template>
```

```html
<script setup>
  const openContact = () => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const createContact = () => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const sendEmail = () => {
    /* ... */
  };
  const resetSystem = () => {
    /* ... */
  };

  const menuItems = [
    {
      text: "Open Contact",
      action: openContact,
    },
    {
      text: "Create Contact",
      action: createContact,
    },
    {
      text: "Send Email",
      action: sendEmail,
    },
    {
      text: "Reset System",
      action: resetSystem,
      danger: true,
    },
  ];
</script>
```

We don't have less code, but we have _simpler_ code:

- **It's easier to read configuration** ‚Äî Reading code is complicated because you have to figure out what the logic is doing, but configuration is very straightforward to understand.
- **Less logic means less bugs** ‚Äî The config above is just a boring array with some objects. It's pretty simple, so it's unlikely that bugs would come from there.
- **Dynamic components are more flexible** ‚Äî Because we've made this menu component dynamically render out the different menu items, we gain tremendous flexibility.

I've written much more on [this idea here](http://michaelnthiessen.com/reducing-redundant-repetition).

## üìú I wrote my own Vue.js

A story that most of us can relate to. When do you use an existing solution or write it from scratch yourself?

## üß† Spaced-repetition: What are all these loops for?

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews üë®‚Äçüî¨**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

I always forget this, so this tip is mostly for me ‚Äî hopefully, I won't have to keep looking this up!

We have 3 types of `for` loops in Javascript:

1. `for...in`
2. `for...of`
3. `for`

But how do you know which one to use?

For iterating through **properties** of an object, use `for...in`:

```javascript
const numbers = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
};

// We get the properties of the object, not the values
for (const number in numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}

// Prints: 'one' 'two' 'three'
```

Items in a **list** (also called an iterable object) like an Array or Set, we use `for...of`:

```javascript
const numbers = ["one", "two", "three"];

// We get each of the elements in the Array
for (const number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}

// Prints: 'one' 'two' 'three'
```

You _can_ use `for...in` with an Array since all the indices are just the object's properties. But you may not get them in the correct order, and you'll also get any other properties the Array has :/

And you know how to use a regular old `for` loop, which lets you have a lot more control with some extra typing.
