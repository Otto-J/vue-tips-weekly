# 🔥 (#69) 改进我的电子书工具

July 2022

Hey,all!
嘿，各位！

This last week I spent some time updating my ebook tool.
上周我花了一些时间来升级我的电子书工具。

I don't know how often I'll be publishing ebooks, but the easier it is the more likely I'll do it. And nice tools are just fun to work on!
我不知道未来多久发布电子书，如果越容易制作我就越容易发布。好的工具会很有趣！

Taking inspiration from Nuxt, I decided to use a folder-based set up. Mine is a little different though:
收到 Nuxt 的启发，我决定使用基于文件夹的方式。但我的会略有不同：

```
content/
layouts/
styles/
table-of-contents.json
```

All the Markdown goes into `content/`, with a front matter field to specify which layout to use:
所有的 Markdown 文件放入 `content/` 中，带有一个 front matter 字段用来设定布局方式：

```
---
layout: chapter
title: Forgotten Features
subtitle: "All those things you forgot Vue could do, or didn't know about in the first place."
---
```

The layouts are HTML with some basic mustache interpolation using the `mustache` package:
布局文件使用 `mustache` 包提供的有 mustache 语法来组织 HTML：

```html
<div class="chapter">
  <h3>Chapter</h3>
  <h1>{{ &title }}</h1>
  <p>{{ &subtitle }}</p>
</div>

<div class="tips">{{ &content }}</div>
```

I run all the fields through a Markdown parser so I can have Markdown styling in any field. But that means I need to escape all the HTML tags using the `&<var>` syntax.

All of the styles are still in one file. But I plan on having a single stylesheet per layout —at some point.

Lastly, the `table-of-contents` JSON is an array that specifies the order of the content:

```
[
  "cover",
  "table-of-contents",
  "intro",
  "ch-css",
  //...
  "ch-forgotten",
  "back-cover"
]
```

But enough about that!

Here are your tips.

## 🔥 6 Levels of Reusability

There are six different levels of reusability that you can use in your components.

Each level adds more complexity but also increases your ability to reuse code.

These levels are the focus of my course, Reusable Components.

Here are the six levels of reusability:

1. **Templating** —Reusing code by wrapping it up inside of a component
2. **Configuration** —Using configuration props to allow for varying behaviour
3. **Adaptability**—Allowing components to become future-proof
4. **Inversion** —Letting other components control the process
5. **Extension** —Using reusability throughout our component
6. **Nesting**—Creating powerful hierarchies of components

I cover this in more detail in [this excerpt from the course](https://michaelnthiessen.com/6-levels-of-reusability).

## 🔥 Check Vue’s Version

Did you know that you can easily check the version of Vue at runtime?

```javascript
import { version } from 'vue';

if (version.split('.')[0] === '2') {
  console.log('Uh, this app is gonna crash.');
  console.log('Upgrade to Vue 3!');
}
```

## 📜 How to clean up global event listeners

Markus wrote a great article on the best way to deal with event handlers in your component.It took me awhile to get into the habit of properly dealing with event handlers like this.

I recently was working on a component that had about 7 or 8 global event handlers, so I used this array pattern:

```javascript
export default {
  created() {
    // Add directly so it doesn't become reactive
    this.eventListeners = [
      ['mouseout', this.handleMouseOut],
      ['click', this.handleClick],
      // ...
    ];

    for (const [event, handler] of this.eventListeners) {
      window.addEventListener(event, handler);
    }
  },

  beforeDestroy() {
    for (const [event, handler] of this.eventListeners) {
      window.removeEventListener(event, handler);
    }
  },
};
```

Arrays are nothing new, but it was a nice way to clean it up.

## 💬 Two Types of Languages

## 🧠 Spaced-repetition: Deep Linking with Vue Router

**The best way to commit something to long-term memory is to periodically review it, gradually increasing the time between reviews 👨‍🔬**

**Actually remembering these tips is much more useful than just a quick distraction, so here's a tip from a couple weeks ago to jog your memory.**

You can store (a bit of) state in the URL, allowing you to jump right into a specific state on the page.

For example, you can load a page with a date range filter already selected:

```
someurl.com/edit?date-range=last-week
```

This is great for the parts of your app where users may share lots of links, for a server-rendered app, or for communicating more information between two separate apps than a regular link provides typically.

You can store filters, search values, whether a modal is open or closed, or where in a list we've scrolled to — perfect for infinite pagination.

Grabbing the query using `vue-router` works like this (this will work on most Vue frameworks like Nuxt and Vuepress too):

```javascript
const dateRange = this.$route.query.dateRange;
```

To change it we use the `RouterLink` component and update the `query`:

```html
<RouterLink
  :to="{
  query: {
    dateRange: newDateRange
  }
}"
></RouterLink>
```

Here's a demo of this in action:
